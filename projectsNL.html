                    Pong the 2D game I made in first year of the education software development at SintLucas. <br>
                    The pong game is the first game I ever made using c# and unity, the pong game is a game where a ball bounces around
                    and to paddles are trying to make a goal in the opposite side. <br>
                    I was the only person who made the game so I did a little bit of the design and the coding was al made by myself.<br>
                    I learned a lot during this project because I never used Unity and the lanuage c#. I had to make this game for a school project<br>
                    it was really fun to make it but I find myself more making websites and apps.

                    ThreadWear, is the website what I first made in the first year of the education software development at SintLucas.<br>
                    It is a website I made for myself that I made with HTML & CSS, it was really fun to make because I was not really<br>
                    good at using HTML & CSS but I think I did a really good job making a kind of nice and easy website for the people<br>
                    that want to sell and resell there own shoes. I made the website all by myself with the help of the teachers.<br>
                    I had to make this website for my ambition project for school, the teachers who gave me a grade where really impressed<br>
                    what I made in the first year of my education, and with this project I know I would go more into web and app development<br>
                    than game development.
