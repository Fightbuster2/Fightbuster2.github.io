                    Pong the 2D game I made in first year of the education software development at SintLucas. <br>
                    The pong game is the first game I ever made using c# and unity, the pong game is a game where a ball bounces around
                    and to paddles are trying to make a goal in the opposite side. <br>
                    I was the only person who made the game so I did a little bit of the design and the coding was al made by myself.<br>
                    I learned a lot during this project because I never used Unity and the lanuage c#. I had to make this game for a school project<br>
                    it was really fun to make it but I find myself more making websites and apps.

                    ThreadWear, is the website what I first made in the first year of the education software development at SintLucas.<br>
                    It is a website I made for myself that I made with HTML & CSS, it was really fun to make because I was not really<br>
                    good at using HTML & CSS but I think I did a really good job making a kind of nice and easy website for the people<br>
                    that want to sell and resell there own shoes. I made the website all by myself with the help of the teachers.<br>
                    I had to make this website for my ambition project for school, the teachers who gave me a grade where really impressed<br>
                    what I made in the first year of my education, and with this project I know I would go more into web and app development<br>
                    than game development.

                    Webshop, this webshop is for me te first time using JavaScript. It was a nice project but I found out during this project that JavaScript for me a little bit difficult was but eventualy with the help of my teachers I was really happy with the end product.
                    I learned alot with this project about JavaScript and I know that I have to learn more about it in the future. This project was really based on JavaScript so I let the CSS code a little bit behind so I could more focus on JavaScript. In this webshop you can
                    press on the image so a backdrop pops up with information about the penicel, you can press in the backdrop add to cart so you can add the product that you want into the cart with the price, you can also add multiple products at the same time and the price adds up. When you hover over checkout you see a tooltip with the information what happens when you press it, when you press it the shop reset itself and you have payed for it.
